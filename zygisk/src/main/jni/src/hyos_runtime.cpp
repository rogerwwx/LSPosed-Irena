/**
 * @file hyos_runtime.cpp
 * @brief Native hooking support for applications running on the HyperOS Rust Runtime.
 *
 * A process spawned by /system_ext/bin/hyos_spawner is not an ART process. It has no JVM, no
 * JNIEnv, and no binder of its own, so none of the machinery the rest of the framework is built on
 * is available inside it: the framework DEX cannot be loaded, and the daemon cannot be asked what
 * is in scope. What such a process does have is the dynamic loader, and therefore native libraries.
 *
 * This translation unit is the whole of the framework's presence there. It is compiled into the
 * same liblspd.so the Zygisk loader injects everywhere else, and it is reached through Zygisk
 * Next's Runtime API, which the module declares itself for in zn_modules.txt:
 *
 *   path=/system_ext/bin/hyos_spawner companion zygisk/arm64-v8a.so
 *
 * The flow, in order:
 *
 *   1. Zygisk Next injects this library into hyos_spawner and calls `zn_module`'s onModuleLoaded.
 *      getRuntime() reports ZN_RUNTIME_HYOS, and we register `zn_companion_module`'s callbacks.
 *   2. The spawner forks an application process, applies its uid, gid, groups and SELinux context,
 *      and calls onAppSpecialized in the child.
 *   3. The child asks the companion -- a root process Zygisk Next forked for us, reached over a
 *      socket the spawner connected and every child inherited -- for the path the LSPosed daemon
 *      publishes its per-package state under.
 *   4. The child reads the index for its own package, which names the native libraries of every
 *      Xposed module in scope for it, and loads each one. Each library's `native_init` is then
 *      called with the same NativeAPIEntries an ART process gets, so a module's native part needs
 *      no change to work here: it hooks the HyperOS process with the primitives it was already
 *      written against.
 *
 * The hook primitives come from Zygisk Next rather than from our own Dobby, for the reason
 * SetHookBackend documents: two engines patching the same address destroy each other's trampolines,
 * and the engine that already owns this process has the better claim.
